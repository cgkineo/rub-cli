# rub-cli
Extends the ``grunt`` commands which come with Adapt Framework.  

### Support

### Installation
Please make sure you leave the following files and folders in your development folder:  

``node_modules`` (if it's there)  
``grunt``

Then run ``npm install -g rub-cli grunt-cli``  

**N.B. it is critical to install ``grunt-cli`` otherwise the commands may fail silently.**

```

### Tech Spec
1. Run ```rub techspec```
2. Edit ```techspec.json```
3. Run ```rub techspec```

### Including/excluding plugins
If one (or more) of your modules only uses a subset of the installed plugins, you can specify which should be included by adding the following to the `config.json` for that module:
```json
"build": {
	"includes": [
		"adapt-contrib-media",
		"adapt-contrib-narrative",
		"adapt-contrib-bookmarking",
		"adapt-contrib-pageLevelProgress",
		"adapt-quicknav"
	]
}
```

### Changing ``.json`` file endings
Add to Adapt framework ``package.json``
```json
    "grunt": {
        "options": {
            "jsonext": "txt"
        }
    }
```

### IMSMANIFEST.XML variable replacement
```
@@course.title
@@course.customName.subAttributeName
@@config.anyOtherName
```
You can only use variables from config and course.

### Tracking Ids
These three commands (``tracking:remove``, ``tracking:insert`` and ``tracking:remove``) will change the ``src/course`` if youâ€™re using the Adapt Learning structure, or the ``builds/moduleName/course/`` files otherwise.

### Flags vs commands vs options
Commands will typically run at the exclusion of all other non-dependent tasks, such that ``rub prettify`` will only perform a json prettification task. Flags now assume a build should happen, such that ``rub -P`` will build and prettify, ``rub -Pz`` will build, prettify and zip, etc. Options specify a value, such as `rub -p=10`, to allow 10 parallel tasks.

### Migrating from adapt-cli to rub
In order to use rub, your Adapt project's folder structure will require a few changes.

1. Create a `builds` folder in the root of your project.
2. Run `grunt build` to create your initial course. This creates a course folder called `build.`
3. Move the `build` folder into the `builds` folder and rename it using your course name (ex. `p101`).
4. Finally, delete the `course` folder that lives in `src`. Otherwise, the `build` folder will be recreated each time you run rub.

Now, you're ready to run rub with your new course.
